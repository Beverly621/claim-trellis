# ClaimTrellis v0.1 decisions and release gates

**Current status: ClaimTrellis v0.1 — Feature Frozen / Public Pre-Release**

The v0.1 product direction is frozen. ClaimTrellis is an independent project and its only
primary brand. TypeSafe Jev is the first structured judgment provider and part of the
technical lineage, not the product identity.

## Feature-freeze policy

The product features, external API, data model, CLI commands, provider architecture, and
six-label judgment system are frozen after the authorized exception below. The owner has
confirmed the repository is now public. Do not publish
to PyPI, create a formal release, or perform promotional activity. New features and
nonessential dependency upgrades are paused.

Changes during the freeze are limited to:

- bug and security fixes;
- test, CI, type-checking, and reliability improvements;
- refactoring that does not change external behavior;
- documentation and benchmark preparation;
- UI refactoring explicitly requested by the repository owner; and
- domain or Vercel deployment configuration explicitly requested by the repository owner.

Do not run or claim the `<1% false-support rate` target without a formally adjudicated,
held-out benchmark. Do not change the brand, positioning, license, or release strategy
without an explicit decision from the repository owner.

## Repository development route

The owner confirmed public visibility and working Cloudflare/DNS/Vercel infrastructure.
This UI/review change does not alter that infrastructure or authorize a production deployment.
The default branch follows the standard safety policy for a mature repository:

- never force-push or delete `main`;
- develop every change on a separate branch and merge it through a pull request;
- require the `test` CI check to pass before merging;
- do not merge nonessential Dependabot upgrades during the feature freeze; and
- do not make the repository public merely to obtain branch-protection features.

Keep `main` protected with pull requests, the `test` status check, resolved conversations,
linear history, and blocked force-pushes and deletions. A
second-person approval is not required while the project has a single maintainer.

## Authorized v0.1 exception: UI and proposal revision loop

The owner authorized UI Design v1 and the minimum backend changes for versioned provider
proposals, human feedback, accept/reject/revise/defer, optimistic concurrency, idempotency,
failure recovery, and append-only lifecycle events. Six relation labels, CLI commands,
provider abstraction, brand, and license remain unchanged. No new dependencies are required.

This exception ends with the implementation on `codex/ui-design-v1`; further features
remain frozen. Review the PR before merging. No PyPI publication, formal Release,
production configuration change, or production deployment is authorized by this exception.
The owner's current public-repository update supersedes the older private-only wording
in the exception brief. See [the implementation contract](UI_AND_REVIEW_V1.md).

## Human release gates

The following require accountable human action before or during release:

1. Complete PyPI, GitHub, web, USPTO, WIPO, and target-market name checks. A free package
   name is not a trademark clearance.
2. Review actual source and dependency provenance. Copying code or assets can create
   license obligations even when public Git history starts clean.
3. Enable GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting. Do not publish a personal email merely
   to fill a template field.
4. Appoint benchmark annotators and an adjudicator before making accuracy claims.
5. Review TypeSafe terms and institutional policy before sending confidential,
   unpublished, personal, or protected material.
6. Do not publish a performance claim until a frozen held-out evaluation is complete.

These gates do not block transparent experimental open-source publication. Releases must
remain `0.x experimental` until the validation and governance requirements are met.
